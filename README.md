# gentoo-dotfiles
personal Gentoo dotfiles + scripts

I'm only putting these on here since I uninstall/reinstall a lot and like to keep my dots updated.

I use a combination of xmonad+zsh+alacritty, but I also include these dotfiles:

- xmonad/bar
- Alacritty
- zsh, fish and bash config
- .Xresources
- init.vim/vimrc
- sxhkd/bspwm
- i3-gaps
- a bunch of other shit

included scripts:

- system maintenance script (does lots of stuff)
- resolution changer (frontend for xrandr)
- AUR helper (type in an AUR package and it will clone, make and install it)
