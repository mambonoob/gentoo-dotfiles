# gentoo-dotfiles
personal Gentoo dotfiles + scripts

I'm only putting these on here since I uninstall/reinstall a lot and like to keep my dots updated.

I use a combination of bspwm+zsh+alacritty, but I also include these dotfiles:

- bspwm/sxhkd
- Alacritty
- zsh, fish and bash config
- .Xresources
- vim
- i3-gaps
- a bunch of other shit

included scripts:

- resolution changer (frontend for xrandr)
