# gentoo-dotfiles
personal Gentoo dotfiles + scripts

I'm only putting these on here since I uninstall/reinstall a lot and like to keep my dots updated.

I include these dotfiles:

- Doom Emacs/EXWM
- openbox
- i3
- Alacritty
- .bashrc 
- .Xresources
- (n)vim
- some other stuff

included scripts:

- resolution changer (frontend for xrandr)
- simple rofi loader to simplify i3 config
